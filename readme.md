This is an IDE and validator for mIRC scripting.
At this point, it's still very much a work in progress, and may crash a lot.

Features:
  * Customisable syntax highlighting for mIRC remote, alias and popup scripts
  * Error checking for mIRC scripts
  * Synchronisation with running mIRC instances
  * Variable matching (when the cursor is on a variable, highlights other uses of it)
  * Hash table editor
  * Dialog table designer
